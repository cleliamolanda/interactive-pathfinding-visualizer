# Interactive Pathfinding Visualizer

This project is an interactive pathfinding visualizer built with JavaScript. It allows users to visualize how pathfinding algorithms, specifically the A* (A-star) algorithm, work on a grid-based map. The visualizer demonstrates how the algorithm explores nodes and finds the shortest path between two points, considering obstacles and different movement costs.

## Features

- **A* Pathfinding Algorithm:** Efficiently finds the shortest path between start and end nodes.
- **Grid-Based Visualization:** Users can see the algorithm's progress in real-time on a 2D grid.
- **Customizable Grid:** Supports different grid sizes and obstacle placements.
- **Diagonal Movement:** Optionally allows diagonal movement between nodes.
- **Heuristics:** Includes Manhattan and diagonal heuristics for pathfinding.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cleliamolanda/interactive-pathfinding-visualizer.git
